# The World Wide Web Project

## Context
The son of computer scientists, Berners-Lee was born in London in 1955 (the same year as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates) and studied physics at Oxford. While employed at CERN in the 1980s, Berners-Lee observed how tough it was to keep track of the projects and computer systems of the organization’s thousands of researchers, who were spread around the globe. As he later stated: "In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer."

In March 1989, Berners-Lee gave managers at CERN a proposal for an information management system that used hypertext to link documents on different computers that were connected to the Internet. (Hypertext, a term coined in 1963, allows a person to get a document or piece of content by clicking on a coded word or phrase.) Labelled “vague but exciting” by his boss, the proposal at first wasn’t accepted. Berners-Lee teamed up with Robert Cailliau, a Belgian engineer at CERN, to refine the proposal, and in 1990 the Englishman’s boss gave him time to work on the project. After originally calling the project Information Management, Berners-Lee tried out names such as Mine of Information and Information Mesh before settling on WorldWideWeb.

By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee, using a Steve Jobs-designed NeXT computer, had developed the key technologies that are the bedrock of the Web, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), for creating Web pages; Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for transferring data across the Web; and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), or Web addresses for finding a document or page. He also had devised a basic browser and Web server software.

The beginning of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet arrived on August 6, 1991, when Berners-Lee published the first-ever website. Fittingly, the site was about the World Wide Web project, describing the Web and how to use it. Hosted at CERN on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer.

### Tasks:

### Task 1 :: Create Header and Paragraph

- Open the index.html file provided inside the boilerplate code​
- Inside the `body` tag, add `h1` tag to create page heading.​
- The heading should contain following text “World Wide Web”​
- Add  `p` tag with the following text:​`The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents. Everything there is online about W3 is linked directly or indirectly to this document, including an executive summary of the project, Mailing lists, Policy , November's W3 news , Frequently Asked Questions`

### Task 2 :: Create Definition Lists
- Inside index.html file, add `dl` tags to add definition list in the web page.​
- The list should appear after the paragraph content added in the previous task.​
- Following are the text to be added inside `dt` elements. Enclose the text within `a` tag as these are hyper texts.​
    - What's out there?​
    - Help​
    - Software Products​
    - Technical​
    - Bibliography​
    - People​
    - History​
    - How can I help?​
    - Getting code
- Following are the text to be added inside `dd` elements. Use `a` tag to create hypertext based on the output shown.​
    - Pointers to the world's online information, subjects, W3 servers, etc.​
    - on the browser you are using​
    - A list of W3 project components and their current state. (e.g. Line Mode, X11 Viola, NeXTStep, Servers, Tools, Mail Robot, Library)​
    - Details of protocols, formats, program internals etc​
    - Paper documentation on W3 and references.​
    - A list of some people involved in the project.​
    - A summary of the history of the project.​
    - If you would like to support the web.​
    - Getting the code by anonymous FTP , etc.​
